= Custom Access Decision Voter

The goal of this workshop is to restrict access to spreadsheets based on the active user.

The access permissions are stored in a repository; Up to you to verify access through a voter!

== Getting things done
* First we are going to add a `SpreadsheetAccessDecisionVoter` to the application as described link:https://github.com/timtebeek/spring-security-samples/tree/main/access-decision-voter#accessdecisionvoter[here]. We'll complete the implementation of the `hasSpreadsheetAccess` method in step 3.
* Now we have to configure the application properly, so the voter will be picked up by the configuration as described link:https://github.com/timtebeek/spring-security-samples/tree/main/access-decision-voter#configuration[here]
* Now we go back to our `SpreadsheetAccessDecisionVoter` and implement the `hasSpreadsheetAccess` method so our test will succeed.Don't forget to make use of the link:src/main/java/com/jdriven/access/SpreadsheetAccessStore.java[access store] to verify the access. Some hints can be found link:https://github.com/timtebeek/spring-security-samples/tree/main/access-decision-voter#tests[here]
