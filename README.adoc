= Spring Security Workshop

A collection of Spring Security 5.7+ challenges; Part of a https://github.com/timtebeek/spring-security-samples[Spring Security blog series],
and closely linked to the https://github.com/timtebeek/spring-security-samples[Spring Security Samples repository].

The project is divided into separate submodules, each of which demonstrates a single feature in isolation.
While submodules can be combined to form a larger solution, we thought separating the functionality would make it easier to comprehend and extend.

== Requirements

In order to participate, you will need the following:

- Basic Spring knowledge
- Java 11+
- IDE of your choice
- https://projectlombok.org/[Lombok IDE plugin]
- `https://curl.se/[curl]` or `https://httpie.io/[httpie]` or `IntelliJ HTTP Client`
- `docker-compose`, for Keycloak (optional)

TIP: Use https://sdkman.io/ or https://scoop-docs.vercel.app/ to easily install Java.

== Getting started

1. Clone this Git repository.

  git clone https://github.com/jdriven/spring-security-workshop.git

2. Verify the tests for the `adding-spring-security` module (only).

  ./mvnw -B verify --file adding-spring-security/pom.xml

3. The other modules will have compilation failures or failing tests, as their implementation is (intentionally) incomplete.
It's up to you to implement the functionality to fix the tests!

4. If you are new to Spring Security, start with link:adding-spring-security/README.adoc[Adding Spring Security]!

5. Once you have completed the basics, continue with any of the other modules.
