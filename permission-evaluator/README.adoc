= Custom Permission Evaluator

The goal of this workshop is to restrict access to spreadsheets based on the active user, with separate rights to read/write/print spreadsheets.

The access permissions are stored in a repository; Up to you to verify access through a permission evaluator!

== Getting things done
* link:https://github.com/timtebeek/spring-security-samples/tree/main/permission-evaluator#permissionevaluator[Create a `CustomPermissionEvaluator`] (hint: implements `PermissionEvaluator`) which verifies access against the `SpreadsheetPermissionStore`
* Don't forget to configure method security
* `PreAuthorize` our custom link:src/main/java/com/jdriven/permission/SpreadsheetPrintAccess.java[`SpreadsheetPrintAccess`] annotation to allow printing
* link:src/test/java/com/jdriven/service/SpreadsheetServiceIntegrationTest.java[Run the tests] to verify your implementation
