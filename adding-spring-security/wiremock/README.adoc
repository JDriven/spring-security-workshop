= Using WireMock to serve `issuer-uri`

Our application needs to connect to an OpenID Connect provider to bootstrap the application context.

Use these WireMock stubs to bypass the Keycloak setup, for example when Docker is not available.

== Running WireMock
To serve the recorded mappings with WireMock:

1. https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/tomakehurst/wiremock-jre8-standalone/2.33.2/wiremock-jre8-standalone-2.33.2.jar[Download WireMock standalone], and store it inside the `adding-spring-security/wiremock/` folder.
2. Run `java -jar wiremock-jre8-standalone-2.33.2.jar --port 8090`, from the `adding-spring-security/wiremock/` folder.
3. Verify you get a JSON response from:
http://localhost:8090/auth/realms/spring-cloud-gateway-realm/.well-known/openid-configuration

== Recording with WireMock

NOTE: Not needed for the workshop! Only here to inform how we captured these recordings.

We've previously ran WireMock in proxy mode to record the calls made to our Keycloak OpenID Connect provider:
[source,bash]
----
java -jar wiremock-jre8-standalone-2.33.2.jar --port 8090 --record-mappings --proxy-all="http://localhost:8091"
----
The resulting `mappings` and `__files` can be found in this folder.
