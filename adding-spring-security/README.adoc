= Adding Spring Security

Adding Spring Security to an existing application can be quite a daunting prospect.
Merely adding the required dependencies to your project sets off a chain of events which can break your application and tests.

Maybe you're suddenly shown a login prompt which expects a generated password logged on startup. +
Maybe your tests now get the dreaded `401 Unauthorized`, or a subsequently a `403 Forbidden`. +
Maybe you get a `ClassCastException` when trying to use your `Authentication#getPrincipal()`. +
So this should be fun!

The goal of this workshop is to add Spring Security to an existing application.

Imagine a Human Resources department that has a small application to track and approve/deny leave requests.
Initially this application was only used from within the HR department, who received requests via phone or email.
You can see the application in this state in link:leaveapp-initial/[leaveapp-initial], along with the current set of application tests.

Now we want to open up this application to all employees, so they can view and file (only their own) leave requests themselves.
Anyone from the HR department can then either approve or deny a leave request, and view all requests.
Up to you to implement these requirements for this small application, starting from the commented out dependency.

== Mock Keycloak
To save you from having to setup an OpenID Connect provider just yet, we've recorded the requests and responses needed for this workshop Follow link:leaveapp-complete/src/test/resources/README.adoc[these] instructions to run WireMock.
These recordings come from Keycloak, with setup covered in the link:../spring-cloud-gateway-oidc-tokenrelay/README.adoc[Spring Cloud Gateway with OpenID Connect workshop].

== Getting things done
* Read link:https://github.com/timtebeek/spring-security-samples/blob/master/adding-spring-security/README.adoc#what-happens-when-you-add-the-dependency[What happens when you add the dependency?] and add the Spring Security dependencies to the project in the link:pom.xml[pom].
* link:https://github.com/timtebeek/spring-security-samples/blob/master/adding-spring-security/README.adoc#fixing-our-tests-part-1[Fix the user authorization tests] in the `AutoriseUser` tests in the link:leaveapp-initial/src/test/java/com/jdriven/leaverequest/[test package]

Now we have secured the application on a user level, but what about roles?

* Read about link:https://github.com/timtebeek/spring-security-samples/blob/master/adding-spring-security/README.adoc#roles-and-authorizations[authorization on role level] and apply the suggested changes in the application.
* link:https://github.com/timtebeek/spring-security-samples/blob/master/adding-spring-security/README.adoc#fixing-our-tests-part-2[Fix the role authorization tests] in the `AuthorizeRole` tests in the link:leaveapp-initial/src/test/java/com/jdriven/leaverequest/[test package]

If you get stuck at any point, link:leaveapp-complete/[leaveapp-complete] shows the application in a final form, with `src/main` and `src/test` updated to the above specification.

Your implementation could of course differ from ours; It'll be interesting to compare your approach with ours!
