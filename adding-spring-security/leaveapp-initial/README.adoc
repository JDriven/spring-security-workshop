= Leave app

Imagine a Human Resources department that has a small application to track and approve/deny leave requests.
Initially this application was only used from within the HR department, who received requests via phone or email.

Now we want to open up this application to all employees, so they can view and file (only their own) leave requests themselves.
Anyone from the HR department can then either approve or deny a leave request, and view all requests.
Up to you to implement these requirements for this small application.

== Usage

Start the application by either running LeaveRequestApplication directly from your IDE, or by running this command from the workshop repository root:

[source,bash]
----
# ~/workspace/spring-security-workshop $
./mvnw spring-boot:run --file adding-spring-security/leaveapp-initial/pom.xml
----

The application exposes a REST API, which you can access with either `httpie` or `curl`.
