= Spring Cloud Gateway with OpenID Connect and Token Relay

The goal of this workshop is to secure a gateway with OpenID, and have JSON Web tokens relayed to backend services.
An OpenID provider, gateway and two backend services have been provided;
Up to you to connect the gateway and backend services to Keycloak, and have the Gateway propagate tokens to the backend.

This workshop requires an OpenID Connect provider, client and user to complete.
We cover link:keycloak/README.adoc[Keycloak setup in our example].

== Getting things done
* link:keycloak/README.adoc[Start a local Keycloak] instance with Docker
* https://github.com/jdriven/spring-security-samples/tree/main/spring-cloud-gateway-oidc-tokenrelay#code[Update] the `SecurityConfig` in the link:travel-gateway/[`travel-gateway`] module
* https://github.com/jdriven/spring-security-samples/tree/main/spring-cloud-gateway-oidc-tokenrelay#configuration[Update] the link:travel-gateway/src/main/resources/application.yml[`application.yml`] with the proper keycloak settings and properly configure the gateway to replay the tokens
* Now we finished the configuration for the `travel-gateway`, continue with the link:https://github.com/jdriven/spring-security-samples/tree/main/spring-cloud-gateway-oidc-tokenrelay#configuration-1[hotels and flights services]
* Start the flights, hotels and gateway applications and link:http://localhost:8080/[open the webpage]. You should see a login screen and once logged in you can navigate through the hotels and flights pages.
