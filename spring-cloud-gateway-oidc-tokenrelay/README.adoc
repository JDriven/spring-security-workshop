= Spring Cloud Gateway with OpenID Connect and Token Relay

The goal of this workshop is to secure a gateway with OpenID, and have JSON Web tokens relayed to backend services.
An OpenID provider, gateway and two backend services have been provided;
Up to you to connect the gateway and backend services to Keycloak, and have the Gateway propagate tokens to the backend.

This workshop requires an OpenID Connect provider, client and user to complete.
We cover link:keycloak/README.adoc[Keycloak setup in our example].
