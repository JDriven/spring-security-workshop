Our tests need to connect to a OpenID Connect provider to bootstrap the application context.
For that we've started keycloak normally, and then setup WireMock to record calls to Keycloak:
`java -jar wiremock-standalone-2.25.1.jar --record-mappings --proxy-all="http://localhost:8090"`
The resulting `mappings` and `__files` can be found in this folder.
